# The Full Size Daryl Bike Giveaway

This document outlines the steps taken to choose the full size Daryl Bike winner. In this repository is a spreadsheet containing a snapshot of all bike owners.

## Eligible Bikes

On the Eligible Bikes Tab there are 3 columns:

- Column A are the wallet addresses of all Bike Owners from the 4/16/2022 Snap Shot plus the Winners of the Model Bike Auctions. There are 5039 rows of holders
- Column B is the `=Rand()` command which generates a random number
- Column C is the values of the first refresh of the randomization that was pasted with Values only

Column C was used as the sort column (Values Low to High) to put the wallet addresses in a randomized order.

The row number of the random order of Bike Holders is what we will determine the winner of the bikes.

## Choosing Numbers

- First person will choose a number from 0 to 5
- If the number 5 is chosen then the second number automatically becomes a zero otherwise the next person chooses a number from zero (0) through nine (9)
- The next person also chooses a number zero (0) through nine (9).
- If a fourth person is needed (depends upon the first number chosen) then that person will also choose a number between zero (0) and nine (9).

These 4 numbers put in order will determine the row number of the winner of the full sized replica bike.

These 3 to 4 people whom we will ask to choose a number will be the first 3 to 4 people to ask a question during the TWD Road Map AMA.
